I chose Visual Studio with my labrotary works because i worked before with it. 
The main purpose of this laboratory work was to familiarize in working with Window Forms.

In this laboratry work I learned how we can making events of multiple elements. Clicking, loading so on..

When I doing this work i also learned about GIT how we can use and why we are using.
