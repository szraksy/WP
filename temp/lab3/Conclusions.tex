\section*{Conclusions}

In lab work nr. 3 I have worked with mouse, GDI Primitives and bezier curves. I had to study the material on these topics. I have learned some of basic windows commands, like creating GDI primitives, bezier curves or working with mouse. All studied topics are really useful working with a Windows application. Now we can work not just with text I/O but also create some images.
