I made 2 different forms on my Second Labrotary work. First form has
custom background image ,listbox which one is represent to the Education
year , a button and a message box.
We are chosing the year of the education from the listbox and we are
clicking to the button when we clicked to the button then message box
appeare and it is saying which year we chosed.
When we click to the Ok on the message box then the second form will be
open.
On the second form we have 5 different menu items, announcement area
with listbox ,a button, a label ,
on the menu side we have 5 different options which are;

	* Changing background color
  * changing window size
  * changing background color of Button
	* Reseting to the default color
  * and exit from the program

When we are clicking to the button then we will see more announcements and the
listboxâ€™s scrollbar will be visible.
On my program i put custom icon.
